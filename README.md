# NSSM Service Manager API üöÄ  

![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-blue)  

A FastAPI-based RESTful API to manage Windows services installed via **NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager)**. This API allows listing, installing, starting, stopping, and removing NSSM-managed services.  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ‚ö†Ô∏è  
This API **exposes service installation, modification, and execution via a web interface**. **DO NOT USE** this if you **do not fully understand the security risks** involved.  
- Running this API on a publicly accessible server **can allow unauthorized users to install or control services**.  
- It is **strongly recommended** to restrict access using a firewall, authentication, or a private network.  
- Use only in **controlled environments** where security measures are in place.  

## üìå Features  

- List all NSSM-installed services.  
- Retrieve service details (executable path, startup directory, arguments, and status).  
- Install a new Windows service using NSSM.  
- Start and stop NSSM services.  
- Remove services.  

## üõ† Requirements  

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Windows OS** (NSSM is Windows-only)  
- **NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager)**  
- **Administrator privileges** (to modify Windows services)  

## üì¶ Installation  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/phintegrator/nssm_service_manager.git
   cd nssm_service_manager
   ```  

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

3. **Ensure NSSM is installed and accessible in your system `PATH`**  
   - Download NSSM from [https://nssm.cc/download](https://nssm.cc/download)  
   - Extract and move `nssm.exe` to a directory in your system's `PATH`  
   - Test installation:  
     ```sh
     nssm --version
     ```  

## üöÄ Usage  

### Start the API Server  
Run the following command to start the API:  
```sh
python fastapi_nssm.py
```  
By default, the server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:54321/`.  

### API Endpoints  

| Method  | Endpoint                         | Description                  |
|---------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `GET`   | `/services`                      | List all NSSM-managed services |
| `POST`  | `/services`                      | Install a new service       |
| `POST`  | `/services/{service_name}/start` | Start a service             |
| `POST`  | `/services/{service_name}/stop`  | Stop a service              |
| `DELETE`| `/services/{service_name}`       | Remove a service            |

### Example API Calls  

#### ‚úÖ List all NSSM services  
```sh
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:54321/services" -H "accept: application/json"
```  

#### ‚úÖ Install a new NSSM service  
```sh
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:54321/services" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "service_name": "MyService",
  "executable_path": "C:\\path\\to\\app.exe",
  "startup_directory": "C:\\path\\to",
  "arguments": "--arg1 value1 --arg2 value2"
}'
```  

#### ‚úÖ Start a service  
```sh
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:54321/services/MyService/start"
```  

#### ‚úÖ Stop a service  
```sh
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:54321/services/MyService/stop"
```  

#### ‚úÖ Remove a service  
```sh
curl -X DELETE "http://127.0.0.1:54321/services/MyService"
```  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes  
- This API **requires administrator privileges** to modify services.  
- Ensure **NSSM is installed and in your system PATH** before running the API.  
- NSSM is used for managing long-running services, such as background tasks, web servers, and monitoring tools.
